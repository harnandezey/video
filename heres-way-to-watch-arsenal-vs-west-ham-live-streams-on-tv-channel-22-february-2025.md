After all the hand-wringing about Arsenal‚Äôs lack of a striker, it turns out Mikel Merino may have been the unexpected solution.

Merino eased Arsenal‚Äôs attacking concerns with two late goals off the bench to secure a 2-0 win at relegation-threatened Leicester on Saturday that kept the Gunners in the Premier League title race.

Manchester City has found a new scoring threat, too, even though it might be too late to get involved in the title fight.

January signing Omar Marmoush netted a 14-minute hat trick in the first half of a 4-0 win over Newcastle that lifted Pep Guardiola‚Äôs team into fourth place ‚Äî only three points behind Nottingham Forest, which lost at Fulham 2-1.

With Arsenal playing its first game since leading scorer Kai Havertz was ruled out for the season, its makeshift front three struggled to create chances until Merino ‚Äî a central midfielder ‚Äî went on in the 69th minute to play as a striker.

The Spain international looked like a natural center forward as he quickly got on the end of two good crosses, heading home a pinpoint ball into the box from 17-year-old Ethan Nwaneri in the 81st and then steering in a low assist from Leandro Trossard in the 87th.

Arsenal tried and failed to sign a striker in the January transfer window even before Havertz joined a long list of injured forwards, leaving manager Mikel Arteta with no other option than to tell Merino to play up front.

‚ÄúIt was a bit of a surprise because it‚Äôs the first time in my career I played that position,‚Äù Merino said. ‚ÄúBut he told me go on as a striker and to make sure I go with my strengths. I think I solved it.‚Äù

The win puts Arsenal within four points of leader Liverpool, which can restore the gap to seven points when it hosts Wolves at home on Sunday.

The Gunners are 8 points behind leaders Liverpool, with Mikel Arteta's frontline now reliant on midfielder Mikel Merino being deployed as a makeshift striker, following injuries to recognized forwards Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz. 

West Ham, meanwhile, will be looking to avoid consecutive London derby defeats after last Saturday's turgid 1-0 loss at the London Stadium to Brentford. Another capital loss here could draw the 16th-placed Hammers closer toward an unwanted battle to beat relegation. 

Arsenal have the chance to narrow Liverpool's lead at the summit of the Premier League to just five points when they visit a struggling West Ham side on Saturday afternoon.

While the league-leading Reds have shown a few signs of fatigue, their hard-earned point at Aston Villa on Wednesday was far from catastrophic. However, that result has cracked open a window for Arsenal to apply some pressure before Liverpool's high-stakes showdown with Manchester City on Sunday.

Mikel Arteta's squad stretched their unbeaten run in the league to 15 matches following a 2-0 victory over Leicester City last weekend. Teen sensation Ethan Nwaneri provided a spark, while a late double from substitute Mikel Merino sealed the deal after a largely uninspiring performance from the Gunners.

The title contenders now face a West Ham team they thrashed 5-2 back in November when Julen Lopetegui was still at the helm. New boss Graham Potter has struggled to engineer a turnaround since taking over, with the Hammers slipping to 16th after a narrow 1-0 home defeat against Brentford last Saturday.
