Pep Guardiola's side will look to bounce back from their disappointing knockout at the hands of Real Madrid through a 3-1 defeat in their last game.

Similarly, Liverpool will look to return to winning ways in the Premier League after a disappointing 2-2 draw with Aston Villa during the midweek.

Pep Guardiola suffered another injury blow in Wednesday's defeat to Real Madrid as John Stones was forced off in the first half. Stones has been nursing a foot issue for most of the year but it appeared that this was something new. While fans await more news on the extent of the issue, it's hard to imagine Stones being available for action so soon.

He joins Manuel Akanji, Oscar Bobb, and Rodri on the shelf, all of whom have missed signifiant time and will likely continue to do so. Bobb was scheduled to return from his broken leg but reportedly twisted his ankle in training, lengthening his return timeline.

Erling Haaland did not feature in the Real Madrid match midweek after tweaking his knee last weekend, but he was on the bench as an unused substitute. He's considered a doubt for this weekend with no real update on his availability.

Liverpool saw Conor Bradley go down with an injury late in the midweek draw with Aston Villa, after he had already come in off the bench. He's almost surely out this weekend, but there's very little news on what the prognosis is beyond the next match.

Arne Slot said that Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota are not yet fit for a full 90 minutes which is why neither is able to last a full match just yet. Without Bradley, it's not clear who could come on at right-back once Trent is withdrawn.

They will hope to have Cody Gakpo back for this match, as Arne Slot called it "a close call" if the Dutchman will be back this weekend, likely down to whether he can return to training before the game. Joe Gomez, meanwhile, is out "for a long time" after another hamstring surgery.

The three-time defending champions are going to need a miracle if they want to make it four straight EPL titles. Manchester City might have beaten up Newcastle United last Saturday, but that has not taken away from some of Cityâ€™s disappointing results this season. There is still time to catch up, but Manchester City continues to flounder, there is a chance they could fall out of the top four.

Most notably, Erling Haaland remains a doubt after the forward sustained a knock in last weekend's 4-0 win over Newcastle and watched the Champions League knockout stage play-offs second leg defeat to Real Madrid as an unused substitute in the midweek.

As it is, John Stones, Manuel Akanji, Oscar Bobb and Rodri are sure to miss out. Meanwhile, whether or not Haaland is passed fit for the tie, Omar Marmoush should feature in the XI.

While Joe Gomez and Tyler Morton are expected to miss the trip due to injuries, Cody Gakpo is a major doubt. Elsewhere, Liverpool manager Arne Slot would also exercise caution with Conor Bradley's hamstring issue. Historically, Mohamed Salah is a goal or assist short of Steven Gerrard's 14 G/A against City in the competition.
