Manchester City host Liverpool in Sunday's big Premier League match at the Etihad Stadium.

Pep Guardiola's side suffered a demoralising UEFA Champions League exit at the hands of Real Madrid this week, and the focus now will be on ensuring they qualify for next season's tournament, with their domestic title defence effectively over.

Liverpool are top of the standings and favourites to usurp City's position as Premier League champions, but the Reds' form has tailed off a little in 2025. The draw with Aston Villa on Wednesday was not a bad result in isolation, but it did give some hope to Arsenal in the title race.

Man City vs. Liverpool lineups, team news
Pep Guardiola suffered another injury blow in Wednesday's defeat to Real Madrid as John Stones was forced off in the first half. Stones has been nursing a foot issue for most of the year but it appeared that this was something new. While fans await more news on the extent of the issue, it's hard to imagine Stones being available for action so soon.

He joins Manuel Akanji, Oscar Bobb, and Rodri on the shelf, all of whom have missed signifiant time and will likely continue to do so. Bobb was scheduled to return from his broken leg but reportedly twisted his ankle in training, lengthening his return timeline.

Erling Haaland did not feature in the Real Madrid match midweek after tweaking his knee last weekend, but he was on the bench as an unused substitute. He's considered a doubt for this weekend with no real update on his availability.

Man City predicted lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Ederson (GK) — Khusanov, Ake, Dias, Gvardiol — Nico, Gundogan, Silva — Foden, Marmoush, Savinho

Liverpool saw Conor Bradley go down with an injury late in the midweek draw with Aston Villa, after he had already come in off the bench. He's almost surely out this weekend, but there's very little news on what the prognosis is beyond the next match.

Arne Slot said that Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota are not yet fit for a full 90 minutes which is why neither is able to last a full match just yet. Without Bradley, it's not clear who could come on at right-back once Trent is withdrawn.

They will hope to have Cody Gakpo back for this match, as Arne Slot called it "a close call" if the Dutchman will be back this weekend, likely down to whether he can return to training before the game. Joe Gomez, meanwhile, is out "for a long time" after another hamstring surgery.
