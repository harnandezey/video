This historic Premier League showdown between Everton and Manchester United is set to unfold at Goodison Park for the final time, as David Moyes prepares to welcome his former side to Merseyside.

Everton currently sits 14th in the league standings, comfortably clear of the relegation battle, with a 13-point cushion over strugglers Ipswich and Leicester. However, they are also 13 points adrift of Bournemouth, who occupy a Europa League qualification spot. The Toffees head into this fixture fresh off a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Crystal Palace in their last outing.

Meanwhile, Manchester United find themselves in 15th place, 12 points above the drop zone but still a distant 14 points away from securing a European berth next season. Their most recent contest saw them suffer a narrow 1-0 defeat on the road against Tottenham.

One point separates the two sides with Everton in 14th place with 30 points and Manchester United in 15th place. Everton have been one of the in-form teams in the Premier League since David Moyes returned to take charge of the club. The Toffees have won four, lost one and drawn one match since Moyes returned.

Ruben Amorim, on the other hand, has found life difficult at Old Trafford since joining in November. The Red Devils are languishing in the bottom half and have a better chance of being relegated than to finish in the top six.

Moyes has plenty of absences to deal with himself, although he will have the welcome return from suspension of Abdoulaye Doucoure this weekend.

There is a chance that the experienced Seamus Coleman could be back, but otherwise, Everton's injury picture looks largely unchanged.

Youssef Chermiti and Nathan Patterson are not yet ready to return. Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Armando Broja are not expected back until March, with Dwight McNeil predicted to be available again in early April. Illiman Ndiaye is facing a few weeks out, and Orel Mangala will not play again until late in 2025. 

There is little let-up in Amorim's problems and the team for this weekend is likely to be very similar to the one that lost to Spurs last week.

Leny Yoro and Christian Eriksen could return from illness, although Amorim stressed that care must be taken with the latter due to his heart condition. Manuel Ugarte will face tests later this week on the knock he sustained in training that kept him out of the game in north London.

Toby Collyer may also be fit enough to make the matchday squad, but the positive news ends there. Mason Mount and Luke Shaw will likely be the first to return among the long-term absentees, but even their comeback dates are unclear.

The Toffees' recovery under Moyes has been as impressive as it has been immediate. The Merseysiders are now 13 points clear of the relegation zone and looking upwards toward midtable security. 

Up next for Moyes is a club that looks dysfunctional both on and off the pitch. A point and a place behind Everton in 15th, Ruben Amorim's Man United look even less assured than during the ill-fated Erik ten Hag era at Old Trafford. They desperately need a win today to stabilize.
