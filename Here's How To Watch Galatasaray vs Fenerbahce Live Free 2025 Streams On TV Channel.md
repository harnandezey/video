The Turkish Super Lig title race could take a decisive twist when Galatasaray welcome bitter rivals and closest title challengers Fenerbahce to Rams Park on Monday night to wrap up round 25.

Galatasaray secured a narrow 2-1 victory over Rizespor in their previous outing. Despite securing the three points, their display left much to be desired, with a late goal masking what was otherwise an underwhelming performance. Their superior quality ultimately proved decisive, but familiar defensive frailties were exposed yet again during a midweek Europa League stalemate with Alkmaar. Frustrations among fans continue to mount, with calls growing louder for manager Okan Buruk to step down.

Holding a six-point lead over Fenerbahce in the standings, Gala don‚Äôt necessarily need a victory in this clash. However, if Buruk opts for a cautious game plan and drops too deep to absorb pressure, it could further strain his already fragile relationship with the supporters.

Meanwhile, Fenerbahce cruised to a 3-1 triumph over Kasimpasa in their latest league fixture. It was a textbook Jos√© Mourinho performance‚Äîefficient, measured, and defined by ruthless finishing rather than relentless attacking play. Unlike their rivals, Fenerbahce also progressed in the Europa League, seeing off Anderlecht to advance.

Despite needing a win to close the gap at the top, Mourinho is unlikely to deploy an overly aggressive approach from the start. Instead, expect the Portuguese tactician to focus on control and discipline, with star man Anderson Talisca set to be his trump card. Having already proven his knack for big-game heroics during his time at Besiktas, Talisca could once again be the difference-maker in this high-stakes derby.

Rams Global Stadyumu

The match will be played at the Rams Global Stadium on Monday, February 24, with kick-off at 12 pm ET/9 am PT for fans in the US.

Galatasaray will be without √Ålvaro Morata, who is sidelined with a hamstring issue. This absence could prompt Okan Buruk to deploy a strike partnership of Ahmed Kutucu and Victor Osimhen up front.

Mauro Icardi remains out for the remainder of the season due to a severe knee injury, while Ismail Jakobs continues to be hampered by an ongoing Achilles problem.

On the other side, Fenerbahce will be without √áaƒülar S√∂y√ºnc√º and Diego Carlos, although Alexander Djiku is expected to bolster the defense after overcoming his injury setback.

Meanwhile, both Jayden Oosterwolde and Rodrigo Bec√£o have suffered season-ending knee injuries, adding to the club‚Äôs defensive woes. Midfielder Ismail Y√ºksek is also unavailable for selection.

Riding high on an eight-game unbeaten streak since early December, Fenerbahce are aiming to narrow their rivals' lead to just three points. Despite reported attempts by Galatasaray to prevent it, a foreign referee has been appointed for the match.

Matchday 25 wraps up with a high-stakes edition of the Turkish Derby, as Galatasaray and Fenerbahce battle for more than just bragging rights‚Äîthis showdown carries major title implications.

Galatasaray sit atop the Super Lig with 63 points and are shifting full focus to domestic competition after a disappointing Europa League exit. Fenerbahce, six points back at 57, are riding momentum from their European success and can close the gap to just three with a statement win in this critical clash.
