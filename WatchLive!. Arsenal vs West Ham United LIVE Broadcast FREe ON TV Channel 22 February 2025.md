Arsenal vs West Ham LIVE. Arsenal host West Ham in the Premier League with kick off at 3pm; Gunners hope to close gap on league leaders
Arsenal have a golden chance to close the gap at the top of the Premier League table when they host West Ham United at the Emirates on Saturday afternoon. A victory would see Mikel Artetaâ€™s side move within five points of leaders Liverpool, who have shown unexpected signs of vulnerability in recent weeks.

The Gunners come into this clash fresh off a 2-0 win against Leicester City, where a new attacking star stepped up to deliver. Meanwhile, West Hamâ€™s struggles deepened following a disappointing 1-0 home defeat to Brentford.

Liverpoolâ€™s recent form has given Arsenal renewed hope in the title race, with Arne Slotâ€™s men dropping points in consecutive 2-2 draws against Everton and Aston Villa, either side of a less-than-convincing win over Wolves.

Arsenal vs. West Ham predicted lineups, team news
Gabriel Jesus will miss the remainder of the season with a long-term knee injury, and Kai Havertz is likely to remain sidelined as well unless he can return just before the campaign's conclusion for the final few games.

Arsenal have been quiet on the eventual return of Bukayo Saka, but it's reported that he is expected back after the March international break, as is Gabriel Martinelli.

Despite his heroics off the bench against Leicester City, it's hard to imagine Arteta putting any long-term faith in Mikel Merino playing central striker. Yet there would be benefits to doing so â€” first and foremost, it would allow Arteta to move Leandro Trossard back to the wing and sit the invisible Raheem Sterling back on the bench.

Arsenal predicted lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Raya (GK) â€” Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Lewis-Skelly â€” Odegaard, Partey, Rice â€” Nwaneri, Merino, Trossard.

Injured: Havertz (hamstring), Jesus (ACL), Saka (hamstring), Martinelli (muscle), Tomiyasu (knee)
Suspended: None

West Ham suffered a major blow as it's been reported that Lucas Paqueta will miss multiple weeks after sustaining an ankle injury in training earlier this week. It remains to be seen if James Ward-Prowse will get a chance to play with Paqueta out, or if Graham Potter will turn to others in the squad.

The Brazilian joins Michail Antonio and Crysencio Summerville on the sidelines, as both individuals are also down for a significant spell. Niclas Fullkrug has had an injury-filled first season with the Hammers and is out until mid-March with a hamstring issue.

This game could be a chance for Evan Ferguson to get his first West Ham start after playing the full second half against Brentford last time out.

West Ham predicted lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Areola (GK) â€” Wan-Bissaka, Mavropanos, Kilman, Emerson â€” Alvarez, Soucek â€” Bowen, Kudus, Soler â€” Ferguson.

Injured: Paqueta (ankle), Antonio (broken leg), Summerville (hamstring), Fullkrug (hamstring)
Suspended: None

Arsenal vs. West Ham prediction
Arsenal may not be the most clinical side at the moment, but creativity shouldnâ€™t be an issue when they take on a struggling West Ham outfit at the Emirates. With Ethan Nwaneri dazzling in recent displays, the hosts have plenty of firepower to break down a visiting defence that has yet to keep a clean sheet in 2025.

West Hamâ€™s confidence is at an all-time low, making this a prime opportunity for Mikel Artetaâ€™s men to take full advantage and tighten the gap on Liverpool. A win here would pile the pressure on the league leaders ahead of their high-stakes showdown with Manchester City on Sunday.

Prediction: Arsenal 2-0 West Ham
