Braga will have the opportunity to kick-start round 23 of the Primeira Liga when they welcome Nacional to the Municipal Stadium on Friday evening.

The hosts remain fourth in the standings, having collected 44 points from 22 games, while the Alvinegros sit 13th with 23 points from the same number of matches.

Braga head into this encounter off the back of a goalless draw on their trip to Vitoria de Guimaraes last weekend, a result that left them trailing the Europa League and Champions League spots by two and six points, respectively.

While the outcome extended the Arsenalists' unbeaten run in the Primeira Liga to six matches, it felt more like two points dropped given they had been level with third-placed Porto and just four points behind Benfica in second.

The result also ended their five-match winning streak in the league, though Carlos Carvalhal's side have shown significant improvement, having won just twice in the previous six matches, including two stalemates and two losses.

Those defeats came at the Municipal against leaders Sporting Lisbon and Casa Pia during a rough patch in which they also settled for draws against Estoril Praia and Famalicao, with their two triumphs in that spell coming on the road.

Now back in form, Braga will be looking to make it three consecutive home victories following wins over Boavista and Gil Vicente, especially with their dominant record against Nacional in mind.

The hosts have triumphed in 12 of the last 14 meetings between the sides across all competitions, including a commanding 3-0 victory in September's reverse fixture.

Braga's upturn can largely be credited to their efficiency at both ends, having netted 10 times during their ongoing six-match unbeaten run while keeping four clean sheets in that period.

Meanwhile, Nacional saw any hopes of consecutive wins dashed after conceding a stoppage-time equaliser in a 2-2 draw against Estoril at Estadio da Madeira last weekend.

Having ended a two-match losing streak with a 2-0 triumph over SC Farense in their previous outing, Tiago Margarido's men appeared set for back-to-back victories after overturning an early deficit through strikes from Dudu Teodora and Daniel Penha, only to be denied at the death by Felix Bacher's 93rd-minute leveller.

Currently four points clear of the relegation playoff spot, Nacional will be eager to extend that cushion with a positive result at the Municipal, knowing that avoiding defeat on Friday would mark the first time in their history they have gone consecutive away matches against Braga without losing, following a dramatic 2-2 comeback in the Taca de Portugal in April 2023.

However, the visitors' dismal record on the road this season casts doubt on their chances, having suffered seven defeats in 11 trips in the league, with their six points leaving them as the fourth-worst travellers in the division.
